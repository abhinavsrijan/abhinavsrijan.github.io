										<p>I graduated with a bachelors degree in chemical engineering and a stint at the biggest oil and gas company in India and started working as a process engineer at a petroproducts company. The CEO of that company had a great influence on me. Observing him tackling one problem after another, taking on so many responsibilities, and taking care of his employees got me interested in how a business is run.</p>  
<p>I then proceeded to work at a management consulting firm, publishing a research report on how digitally savvy Indian states were in 2020. It gave me a chance to engage with several business owners, CIOs, clients, and bureaucrats. It was a most engaging time.</p>
<p>I felt that I needed a more holistic understanding of how a business is run. So, I decided to pursue a masters degree in engineering management, focusing on finance and entrepreneurship. </p>
<p>If ventures are a backbone of our economy, finance is the air it breathes. I was fortunate to be mentored by some of the finest professors who taught me about financing ventures from an early stage to exit, innovating and scaling an enterprise, developing business plans, financial planning and management, economic decision making and project management. </p>
<p>I also engaged in several extra curriculars. I published a whitepaper for an Indian ministry, engaged with an Italian client and helped them break into the Asian market, and worked closely with a venture from the startup incubator at my school. </p>
<p>Now that I have graduated, I wish to work in a strategy role because I love solving complex business problems and it gives me an opportunity to observe how different industries function. </p>
<p>I have also realized a passion for finance. As a man of science, finance intrigues me immensely. I believe it to be the most tangible form of science, touching billions of lives. I would love an opportunity to work in a finance role where I can help companies make more informed financial decisions. </p>
